# 🚀 Deploy in 2 Minutes (Free)

The fastest way to deploy your dashboard for free is using **Netlify Drop**.

## Step 1: Locate the Build File
I have created a production-ready zip file for you:
`outputs/dashboard/crop-faq-dashboard/crop-dashboard-dist.zip`

## Step 2: Drag & Drop
1. Open this URL: [https://app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
2. Drag and drop the `crop-dashboard-dist.zip` file onto the page.
3. Wait just a few seconds...

## Step 3: Done!
Netlify will give you a live URL (e.g., `https://random-name.netlify.app`). 
You can share this link immediately.

## Alternative: Vercel CLI (If you prefer terminal)
If you have Vercel installed (`npm i -g vercel`), you can just run:
```bash
cd "outputs/dashboard/crop-faq-dashboard"
vercel --prod
```
